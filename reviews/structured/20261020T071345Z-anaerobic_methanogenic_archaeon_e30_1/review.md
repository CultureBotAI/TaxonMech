| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exact NCBI taxon, rank and lineage | passed | True | NCBITaxon:93527 | NCBITaxon:93527 denotes anaerobic methanogenic archaeon E30-1 at SPECIES rank beneath NCBITaxon:93506 unclassified Archaea, with genetic code11. All four carried ancestors agree with pinned NCBI and current EFetch in identifier, label and rank. The exact E-series suffix distinguishes this record from similarly named siblings. |
| Complete exact identifier and name inventory search | passed | True | NCBITaxon:93527 | Complete direct reads of all twelve named pinned tables, including ignored files, support one NCBI NAME assertion and zero imported strains. No exact identifier/full-label/slug token matches occur in the nine optional inventories; the pinned taxonomy has no descendants for this target. No GTDB, LPSN, culture, historical aggregate or functional assertion is carried. These are bounded source searches, not worldwide absence claims. |
| Imported strain links | not_applicable | False | NCBITaxon:93527 | No imported BacDive strain or strain-level link is asserted; no physical deposit is inferred from the isolate designation. |
| Historical aggregate edges | not_applicable | False | NCBITaxon:93527 | No historical medium, organism or trait aggregate asserted. |
| Initial quality-gate setup attempt | failed | False | NCBITaxon:93527 | Actual exit 1: missing ruff; superseded by the separately recorded successful full retry. |
| Native strict record validation | passed | True | NCBITaxon:93527 | Actual terminal exit code 0. This exact generated YAML only; its captured bytes remain unchanged. Actual earlier per-target invocation; the receipt retains its original cwd and times. |
| Repository history validation | passed | True | NCBITaxon:93527 | Actual terminal exit code 0. All 17 standalone history records; the generated seed event was also inspected in this target. Reused actual native validation on the unchanged shared base 9b5a8fff5185b38dc5c77bb35235152c81ea7765; the recorded cwd and timestamps identify the original execution. These native corpus/source inputs are unchanged; only new review files differ. This receipt is not a new run on the batch branch and does not validate subsequently saved review bundles. |
| Full-corpus exact reproduction | passed | True | NCBITaxon:93527 | Actual terminal exit code 0. All 625,960 generated taxon YAMLs, not a focused approximation.

## Scientific And Domain Assessments

### Exact taxon and source lineage

identity: supported. Targets: NCBITaxon:93527.

NCBITaxon:93527 denotes anaerobic methanogenic archaeon E30-1 at SPECIES rank beneath NCBITaxon:93506 unclassified Archaea, with genetic code11. All four carried ancestors agree with pinned NCBI and current EFetch in identifier, label and rank. The exact E-series suffix distinguishes this record from similarly named siblings.

### Name classes and nomenclatural scope

nomenclature: supported. Targets: NCBITaxon:93527.

The literal NCBI placeholder anaerobic methanogenic archaeon E30-1 is retained without adding an inferred valid species name. Pinned and current NCBI supply no synonyms. Descriptive metabolic and oxygen wording is source-name text, not separate experimental evidence for a phenotype, gene, pathway or mechanism. The designation is not treated as a registered culture deposit.

### Imported subtree and source assertion units

completeness: supported. Targets: NCBITaxon:93527.

Complete direct reads of all twelve named pinned tables, including ignored files, support one NCBI NAME assertion and zero imported strains. No exact identifier/full-label/slug token matches occur in the nine optional inventories; the pinned taxonomy has no descendants for this target. No GTDB, LPSN, culture, historical aggregate or functional assertion is carried. These are bounded source searches, not worldwide absence claims.

### Unchanged native status and history

provenance: supported. Targets: NCBITaxon:93527.

EXACT grounding and SEEDED mapping agree with exact NCBI identity. The sole seed event at2026-09-13T17:54:04Z matches the latest source extraction time. No native history or scientific status is changed.

## Limits And Additional Notes

- Review bounded to captured source versions. Organism names and isolate labels do not establish independently measured phenotypes, genome equivalence, mechanisms or culture-deposit identity.
- Reused actual native validation on the unchanged shared base 9b5a8fff5185b38dc5c77bb35235152c81ea7765; the recorded cwd and timestamps identify the original execution. These native corpus/source inputs are unchanged; only new review files differ. This receipt is not a new run on the batch branch and does not validate subsequently saved review bundles.
- No generated record or history was edited; curation actions remain proposed.
- Fresh-base canonical recapture preserved all previously reviewed input hashes; original captures and actual transition receipts remain retained.
- Every new bundle still requires its own validate/save/check recipe; baseline native receipts do not claim these later steps have run.

notes:
- No generated record or history was edited; curation actions remain proposed.
- Fresh-base canonical recapture preserved all previously reviewed input hashes; original
  captures and actual transition receipts remain retained.
- Every new bundle still requires its own validate/save/check recipe; baseline native
  receipts do not claim these later steps have run.
